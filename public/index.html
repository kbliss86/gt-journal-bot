But I told you I think it's running through my house or something because now both my girls are sick. Oh, no. Okay. Yes. And I got yeah. I don't have any more shifts this week. I'm only at my own facility, but I do have a shift for Saturday. And Okay. Where I'm at on Saturday, it's at the Beacon in Lake Crystal. Okay. And hold on. You must know. Right? There is an outbreak there. Is there? Okay. So that's a COVID. Okay. Yeah. But, one of the girls out there was telling me that I think 3 of their own staff already came back positive. Oh, no. Okay. So it all there is it's spreading, like, pretty damn fast. Okay. And they have 19 residents and all 17 residents are positive. Oh my gosh. Okay. Yeah. Every single yeah. So I'm not gonna take the risk. Okay. Let's take a look here. I think you have time. I do. That's why I wanted to call. Okay. Yep. You should be able to get that. Yep. You are good. So I can remove that Just on 18th for you. Yeah. And I haven't been going up there for a while. Okay. No. And that's certainly yeah. Like I said, we do like you to keep in those shifts and honor that commitment, but I know, yeah, that's a lot of stuff and and germs and bugs going around your house right now too. So That's okay too. Like like, today, but I was in New Orleans today, and I know they're starting to get an outbreak too. Yeah. I know. It's I hate to say it, but It's it's coming back and it's I don't know if it's true, but I heard that April they're are they gonna take off the mask? Are they do what? I heard that some April, they were gonna remove the mats, like, in facility. I don't you know what? Honestly, I don't think that will ever happen, especially right now with, I mean, you know, possibly. But especially now with so many testing positive, we have a lot of staff that are out too But I just don't know. I mean, they might not make it a CMS guideline, but I don't know how many facilities are gonna actually say, yeah. That's okay now. I know. I I was sick all weekend, but I didn't have any shifts except for that one Sunday. I've been testing constantly. Oh, wow. Because of my and, I don't know if I gave them something or what the hell, but now 2 of mine are sick. Yeah. Oh, that's not never fun. Yeah. How old are they? They know, but it's it's the 2 youngest one. So one of them the youngest one is 4, and then the other one is 7. Oh, gosh. Okay. So, yeah, little enough where it hits them like a truck. So Yeah. Alright. But, yeah, somewhere to do that before I got too late. Okay. No. Yeah. And you're on time. So like I Safe. If you change your mind, let me know. We usually can backfill the beacon pretty easily, so That's a good thing. But, I'll get it removed right now for you, and I hope everybody heals quickly in your home. Alright. Hope you're happy. You're very welcome. Thank you, Virginia. We'll talk soon. Uh-huh. Bye. Bye."</p>
